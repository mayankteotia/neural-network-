    "\n",
    "7. What is a loss function, and why is it crucial for neural network training?\n",
    "A loss function quantifies the difference between the network's predictions and the actual target values. It is essential because it guides the optimization process: the network adjusts its weights to minimize this loss during training.\n",

    "9. How does a neural network learn?\n",
    "A neural network learns through a process called backpropagation:\n",
    "\n",
    "It performs a forward pass to compute predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It calculates the loss (error).\n",
    "\n",
    "It computes gradients of the loss w.r.t. weights (backpropagation).\n",
    "\n",
    "It updates the weights using an optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is repeated iteratively over multiple epochs until the network converges.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is an optimizer in neural networks, and why is it necessary?\n",
    "An optimizer updates the network's weights based on gradients computed during backpropagation. It is necessary because it controls the learning process—how the model adapts to data—and ensures faster convergence to a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Could you briefly describe some common optimizers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) – basic optimizer, updates weights with small steps.\n",

    "Momentum – adds momentum to SGD, helping escape local minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaGrad – adapts learning rates for each parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSProp – handles non-stationary objectives by normalizing gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam – combines momentum and adaptive learning rates (widely used).\n",
    "\n",
    "AdamW – an improved version of Adam with weight decay for better generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Can you explain forward and backward propagation in a neural network?\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward Propagation: Input data flows through the network layer by layer, producing an output (prediction).\n",
    "\n",
    "Backward Propagation: The gradients of the loss with respect to each weight are computed by applying the chain rule (backpropagation). The gradients are used to update weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What is weight initialization, and how does it impact training?\n",
    "Weight initialization sets the initial values for the network's weights before training. Good initialization (like Xavier or He initialization) helps avoid vanishing/exploding gradients and speeds up convergence. Poor initialization can lead to slow learning or network failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the vanishing gradient problem in deep learning?\n",
    "In deep networks, gradients can shrink exponentially as they are propagated backward through layers. This can cause the network’s early layers to learn very slowly or not at all, hindering effective training.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. What is the exploding gradient problem?\n",
    "The exploding gradient problem occurs when gradients grow exponentially during backpropagation, causing numerical instability and very large weight updates that can destabilize learning.\n",
